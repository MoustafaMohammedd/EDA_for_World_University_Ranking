# 🎓 EDA_for_World_University_Ranking

> *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global university rankings to uncover trends, correlations, and insights in higher education performance metrics.*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset containing rankings and performance metrics of universities across the world. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that help understand how universities are evaluated and ranked globally.

The dataset typically includes features like academic reputation, faculty-to-student ratio, international student ratio, research citations, employment outcomes, and more. Through visualization and statistical analysis, this project aims to provide stakeholders — including students, researchers, and policymakers — with meaningful insights into the global university ranking system.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
- Identify key factors influencing university rankings.
- Explore correlations between different ranking indicators.
- Visualize trends across regions, countries, and years.
- Detect outliers or anomalies in the data.
- Provide actionable insights for academic institutions and prospective students.

## 🔍 Key Activities Performed

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Checked shape, data types, missing values, and duplicates.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values using imputation or deletion.
   - Removed irrelevant columns.
   - Converted categorical variables if necessary.
   - Renamed columns for clarity.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Summarized numerical and categorical variables.
   - Identified min/max/mean/std values for key metrics.

4. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution plots (histograms, KDEs) for score components.
   - Bar charts for country-wise university counts.

5. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**
   - Scatter plots to explore relationships (e.g., teaching vs. research scores).
   - Heatmap for correlation between ranking parameters.
   - Boxplots to compare rankings by country or region.

6. **Visualization Highlights**
   - Top N universities by overall score and individual metrics.
   - Regional distribution of top-ranked universities.
   - Trends over time (if time-based data is available).

7. **Insights and Observations**
   - Which factors most strongly correlate with high rankings?
   - Which countries dominate in research, teaching, or employability?
   - How do private and public universities compare?
